<p>SHU Bingo Rules</p>

<p>1) SHU Bingo is just like Bingo!</p>

<p>2) All of the boxes are team related, and only points generated by your Sacred Heart Pioneers will count towards completing your bingo card. Kill 1 refers to the first kill registered by the Sacred Heart team, 13th point refers to the 13th team point. The opponents points, blocks, kills, or aces do not count toward the total for SHU Bingo.</p>

<p>3) When one of your boxes is activated (ie. you have Point 5 and Sacred Heart scores its 5th point) that square will start blinking. You must touch that square to lock it in.</p>

<p>4)The first player to get a column, row, or diagonal with all 5 boxes lit up and locked in will win! You have not won unless all 5 boxes are locked in AND your device confirms that you are the winner.</p>

<p>6) If you win, please loudly proclaim to the world that you are victorious and carefully proceed to the scorers table to collect your prize!</p>

<p>7) You will receive a new board at the beginning of each new set, so if you do not win on the first try get ready for the next game!</p>

<p>8) Every winner will be entered into an end of the year drawing for the chance to win a trip to Florida!</p>

<p>Good luck, and thanks for supporting the team!</p>
